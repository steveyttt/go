# A Repo to host all golang basics

The Repo is built based upon lessons provided by Todd Mcleod - https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-how-to-code/. It can be used as a cheat sheet for most common coding scenarios which can be done with the golang standard lib.

### **var**
```var``` can be used to create local & package wide variables. 

```var z int = 10```

### **type**
GO is all about TYPE! Type can be set when declaring vars, you can configure functions to only allow parameters which are of a specific type. You can create new custom types, you can create custom types based upon pre-existig types:

```
type hotdog int
```

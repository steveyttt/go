good exmples of examples are in code docs are the string package - https://godoc.org/strings#pkg-examples

//import a custom package
create a new package

go get -u github.com/steveyttt/go
reference the repo in your code by full name (and capitalisation)
you should see a fiel appear in your go dirâ€™s pkg directory

when writing documentation and tests for your function think of the acronym BET
